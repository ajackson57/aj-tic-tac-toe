## Introduction
This is a simple tic-tac-toe game developed as a project for a web front-end
coding school project. It currently only supports one user's interactions, you
are playing against yourself. Please see the instructions below.

## Instructions
- [Get Started](https://ajackson57.github.io/aj-tic-tac-toe/)

## Technologies used.
- **Styling** - The Boostrap NAV bar and basic styling were used.
- **HTML** - A table was used for the game board grid.
- **JavaScript** - Events from the table, butons, and the navigation bar drive
  the application. An object with constructors were setup for Games, and Game
  objects. This provided infrastructure for future enhancements. For example
  offline play.

## The Devlopment Story
 - **The Development Process**
 - The development process started with some rough wireframes, some user
   stories, and a quick planning outline. I divided development into feature
   groups and created a branch in Git for each group. The branches were as
   follows:
   - setupGrid - The game engine with the visualization based on a table.
   - setupAuth - The authentication of the user. This is the infrastruture for
     registering a user, and allowing a user to logon. The code is divided
     between api, events, and ui files. The api file makes the actual Ajax calls
     to the api provided.
   - SetupGameApi - similr to the authenticaion code this was focused on setting
     up the use the apu that was provided.
   - addStatistics - The focus here was on setting up the statistics.
   - updateStatistics - The statistics took sometime and needed a lot of testing
     and debuggung when defects were identified.
   - updateUIUX - The UI was first developed with everything visible. This
     branch focused on providing some UI cleanup displaying only those UI
     elements that were relavent for a particular context.
   - updateDocuments - The last branch was focused on updating the documentation.
 - **Problem-Solving Strategy**
 - Initial primary strategy was to use console.log to print out information at
   specific areas in the program flow.
 - Node was used to explore specific issues with objects and arrays.
 - I began to use more of the debugging facilities in the DevTools. I setup
   breakpoints and stepped through the code examining values of objects as I
   stepped through.

## Current Issues to be resolved in the future
- **Future Enhancements**
- I have have implemented a feature to get and display a list of games. The list
  provides game id and "over" status. The user can then select a game and
  continue playing it. Unfortunately I ran into some spurious event issues
  resulting in the display being cleared. This feaure has been removed for now.
- Going forward I can see adding features such as dual player play and offline
  play support.
